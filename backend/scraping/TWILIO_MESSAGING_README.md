# Twilio Messaging Script for Chicago Barbershops

This script automatically sends SMS messages to barbershops from the scraped CSV data using Twilio.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Twilio Account**: You need a Twilio account with:
   - Account SID
   - Auth Token
   - A verified phone number (+1 878 226 9721)

2. **Environment Variables**: Make sure your `backend/.env` file contains:
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
   ```

3. **CSV File**: The script reads from `chicago-barbers-progress-1pages.csv` in the same directory.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Navigate to the scraping directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/scraping
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   node send-twilio-messages.js
   ```

## üìä What the Script Does

1. **Reads CSV Data**: Loads barbershop information from the CSV file
2. **Formats Phone Numbers**: Automatically formats phone numbers to E.164 format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
3. **Sends Messages**: Sends personalized SMS messages to each barbershop
4. **Handles Errors**: Includes retry logic and error handling
5. **Rate Limiting**: Adds 1-second delays between messages to avoid Twilio rate limits
6. **Provides Summary**: Shows detailed results at the end

### Change the Message Template
Edit the `messageTemplate` function in the script:

```javascript
const messageTemplate = (name) => `Your custom message here for ${name}`;
```

### Adjust Rate Limiting
Change the delay between messages:

```javascript
// Change 1000 to desired milliseconds
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
```

### Modify Retry Logic
Adjust the number of retry attempts:

```javascript
// Change maxRetries from 3 to desired number
const result = await sendMessageWithRetry(barber.phone, message, barber.name, 5);
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Missing Twilio credentials" Error
- Check that your `.env` file exists in the `backend` directory
